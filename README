This is a short Ook interpreter written in Python. Turing complete! Run some of the example files like so:

python pooky.py helloworld.ook

TODO:
- A GUI?
- Selector for running programs?
- More advanced "auto-input" for feeding into the program?
  - Done with a !inputstufftexthere by itself on the last line.
