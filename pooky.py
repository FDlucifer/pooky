"""Interpreter for the Ook! programing language, a variant on the more widelyknown brainf*** language, an exercise in designing a minimal Turing complete language. However, Ook! is definitely the choice of the discerning primate.

If you prefer messy characters to simple Ook!, then this interpreter can be coerced into speaking brainf*** too. But it won't like it."""
